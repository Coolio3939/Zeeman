                    <h1>WHY DID WE CHANGE THIS</h1>
                    <p>Well, we have to change with the times. Many other brands have done this move. This is not a radical rebrand which we rip everything out from the soul of the brand. Indeed we keep the themes of Yellow, the sailor theme, and the blue Z; we simply update it. Finally, we will not immediately introduce this logo, we will have a transitionary phase, with a feedback form provided for insight </p>
